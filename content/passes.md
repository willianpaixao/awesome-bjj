## [This Principle WILL Change Jiu Jitsu Forever](https://youtu.be/ugw3FU7DL2E) by Jonathan Thomas

> Sometimes the easiest way to go forward is to figure out what not to do rather than focus on what to do.
Because by process of elimination, it eliminates so many problems.

* Passing the guard doesn't guarantee staying in control on top
* Don't let your neck and back round
* Do not compromise your posture
* Focus on good positioning and not to pass
* Do not pass the guard out of fear of being in the guard
* Anytime our opponent cannot break our posture, they will often have to attack our balance
* When a collar grip is made, make your frame by grabbing the lapel at chest level or pants at knee level
* **The tripod effect**: have a counter frame by creating a tripod wit your both arms and legs forming a great base
* If necessary, lower your hips, open your knees. Standing wide is a great way to keep straight spine and a low base at the same time
